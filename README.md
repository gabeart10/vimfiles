vimfiles
========

My vim setup (nix and Windows friendly).

Here's the thing, since Vim 7.4 all the syntax hilighting anyone could
every really want (ok, so I'm exaggerating a little) is already
included, even for Windows. [If you haven't figured out the git-bash
comes with 7.3 and you just need to update to 7.4 you might try it,
update your PATH and save yourself a day messing around with Pathogen,
Vundle and all the other bundlers rendered largely obsolete by 7.4.

``` bash
 cd ~
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/robmuh/vimfiles.git
 cd vimfiles
 ./setup.pl
 ```
